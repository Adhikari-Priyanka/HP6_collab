implement.py is what the final implementation from raw audio to spectrograms of each 2s looks like.

preprocess.py is where I have defined functions to process audio and create spectrograms

utils.py is where I have defined utility functions

ENB0_test4.py is where I have prepared dataset for ENB0_test4 model
